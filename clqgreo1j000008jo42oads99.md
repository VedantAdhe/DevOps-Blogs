## **Task 1 : Explain about Amazon RDS, Dynamo DB and AWS Lambda.**

### **Amazon RDS:**

* **Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)** is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud.
    
* It's responsible for most management tasks.
    
* By eliminating tedious manual tasks, Amazon RDS frees you to focus on your application and your users.
    

Amazon RDS currently supports the following engines:

* Db2
    
* MariaDB
    
* Microsoft SQL Server
    
* MySQL
    
* Oracle
    
* PostgreSQL
    

### **Dynamo DB**

* Fast, flexible NoSQL database service for single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
    
* Dynamo DB supports key-value and document data models.
    
* Developers can use Amazon DynamoDB to build modern, serverless applications that can start small and scale globally. Amazon DynamoDB scales to support tables of virtually any size with automated horizontal scaling.
    

### **AWS Lambda**

* AWS Lambda is a **serverless, event-driven compute service** that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service **without provisioning or managing servers.**
    
* You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.
    
* There's no charge when your code isn't running.
    

### Task 2: Set up and configure a MySQL database on AWS RDS, ensuring optimal performance Establish a connection between the RDS instance and your EC2 environment

## Migration to Amazon RDS: Elevating Your E-commerce Database Game.

### **1.Setting up MySQL Database on AWS RDS**

#### a. **Access AWS Console:**

* Log in to the AWS Management Console.
    
* Navigate to the RDS service.
    

#### b. **Create a New RDS Instance:**

* Click on "Create Database."
    
* Choose the MySQL engine.
    
* Specify DB details like instance size, storage, and credentials.
    

#### c. **Configure Advanced Settings:**

* Set up the database name, enable automatic backups, and choose the preferred maintenance window.
    
* Adjust security group settings for proper network access.
    

#### d. **Launch the Instance:**

* Review configurations and click "Launch."
    
* Monitor the status until the instance becomes available.
    

#### e. **Database Parameter Group:**

* Adjust MySQL parameters for optimal performance.
    
* Consider parameters like `innodb_buffer_pool_size` for memory management.
    

#### f. **Security Considerations:**

* Manage security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
    
* Use IAM roles for RDS if integration with other AWS services is needed.
    

### **2\. Establishing Connection with EC2 Environment**

#### a. **Navigate to EC2 Dashboard:**

* Head to the AWS Console.
    
* Go to the EC2 service.
    

#### b. **Security Groups:**

* Ensure EC2 instances and RDS instances are part of the same security group.
    
* Update security group rules to allow inbound MySQL traffic.
    

#### c. **IAM Roles for EC2:**

* Attach IAM roles to EC2 instances if secure access to AWS resources is required.
    

#### d. **Install MySQL Client on EC2:**

* Use the package manager to install the MySQL client on your EC2 instances.
    
* This client will be used to connect to the RDS instance.
    

#### e. **Connecting to RDS from EC2:**

* Retrieve the endpoint of your RDS instance from the RDS console.
    
* Use the MySQL client on your EC2 instance to connect to the RDS instance.
    

#### f. **Testing the Connection:**

* Execute sample queries to ensure a successful connection.
    
* Monitor performance and response times.
