## **Introduction:**

In this task, we are going to implement the deployment of an open-source project, WordPress, which is hosted on GitHub and utilizes SQLite as its database. Our deployment strategy involves the utilization of NGINX as a reverse proxy server, containerization through Docker, setting up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins, and implementing monitoring. To successfully accomplish this assignment, please follow the instructions provided in the accompanying document.

To enhance the efficiency of our deployment process, we have opted for Docker. In pursuit of this, we have crafted a Dockerfile and Jenkinsfile that encompass all the essential dependencies, configurations, and deployment of the WordPress application. This approach aims to minimize manual tasks while automating the setup and deployment of the application.

# **Project Selection**

For this assignment, I have chosen to deploy the open-source project “WordPress-sqlite” a WordPress application that uses SQLite for data storage. You can find the project on GitHub

**Prerequisites:**

**1.GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/VedantAdhe/wordpress-sqlite-nginx-docker.git](https://github.com/VedantAdhe/wordpress-sqlite-nginx-docker.git)

**2\. Virtual machine:** To perform all the tasks we need to have a server. I am taking a virtual machine from AWS cloud( I do not have Azure credits to create and manage resources, as we only creating VM it doesn't matter what provider it is, so kindly provide me this flexibility)

## **Steps to Complete the Assignment:**

1. ## **Installation and Configuration:**
    

1. Let's start from creating a VM. I create a Ubuntu VM
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1695746223308/b658a990-a79d-454a-ad0c-f51855202e81.png align="center")

1. Let's install all the required software. As we deploying it on docker we need docker to be installed. Install docker using the given commands
    

```abap
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
docker info
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1695746292920/7c413144-83b0-4a99-a35f-1ff5b0f8b5e9.png align="center")

1. Let's Install Jenkins now, To install Jenkins [https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/) follow this documentation
    

Jenkins needs java to be present, So install Java first

```abap
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre -y
```

1. Then run the given commands to install Jenkins
    

```abap
url -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y
```

Now check if it got installed by running “Jenkins — version ”

1. add Jenkins user to the docker group
    
2. [Now](http://6.Now) you can access the `Jenkins server` on `http://<ip-address>:8080`
    
3. *Ensure all the required ports are opened*
    
4. To get the administrator password go to the instance and run “ **sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initial admin password**

To select Definition as “Pipeline script pipeline script from SCM”, SCM as Git and paste the repository url. As it is public repo no credentials are needed.

Specify the branch name and give the Jenkinsfile path in Script path section. And hit save.

```abap
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Git checkout') {
            steps {
                sh "echo passed"
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh "docker run -d -p 80:80 dorwardv/wordpress-sqlite-nginx-docker"
            }
        }
        
    }
}
```

Now click on Build Now to start the pipeline.

now we can access the application on **&lt;IP-address&gt;:80**

[http://44.202.158.123:8080/](http://44.202.158.123:8080/)

Your Application is Deployed

That’s it! Your GitHub repository is integrated with your Jenkins project.

# **Setup Monitoring:**

For monitoring, I am going to use Prometheus and Grafana:

**Step #1 Creating Prometheus System Users and Directory**

Create a system user for Prometheus using the below commands:

```abap
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false prometheus
```

Create the directories in which we will be storing our configuration files and libraries:

```abap
sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
```

Set the ownership of the /var/lib/prometheus directory with the below command:

```abap
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
```

**Step #2:Download Prometheus Binary File**

Now we will download the latest version of Prometheus. We can copy the download link as per our Operating System from the Prometheus download page

Using the below command we can download Prometheus, here we are downloading the Prometheus 2.46 version, you use the above link to download the specific version.

You need to inside /tmp :

```abap
cd /tmp/
```

Download the Prometheus setup using wget

```abap
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.46.0/prometheus-2.46.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Extract the files using tar :

```abap
tar -xvf prometheus-2.46.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Move the configuration file and set the owner to the Prometheus user:

```abap
cd prometheus-2.46.0.linux-amd64
sudo mv console* /etc/prometheus
sudo mv prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
```

Move the binaries and set the owner:

```abap
sudo mv prometheus /usr/local/bin/
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus
```

**Step #3:Prometheus configuration file**

We have already copied the**/opt/prometheus-2.26.0.linux-amd64/prometheus.yml** file **/etc/prometheus** directory, verify if it is present and should look like below and modify it as per your requirement.

```abap
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

**Step #4 Creating Prometheus Systemd file**

Create the service file using the below command

```abap
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
```

```abap
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
```

```abap
[Service]
User=prometheus
Group=prometheus
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
    --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
    --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
    --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reload system:

```abap
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start, Enable, Status Prometheus service:

```abap
sudo systemctl start prometheus
sudo systemctl enable prometheus
sudo systemctl status prometheus
```

**Step #5:Accessing Prometheus in Browser**

Now as Prometheus installation and configuration is set up and it is ready to use we can access its services via web interface.Also check whether port 9090 is UP in the firewall.

Use the below command to enable Prometheus service in the firewall

```abap
sudo ufw allow 9090/tcp
```

Now Prometheus service is ready to run and we can access it from any web browser.

```abap
http://server-IP-or-Hostname:9090
http://44.202.158.123:9090/
```

As we can see the Prometheus dashboards, we can also check the [target.As](http://target.As) we can observe Current state is UP and we can also see the last scrape.

**Step #6:Download Node Exporter**

Go to the official release page of Prometheus Node Exporter and copy the link of the latest version of the Node Exporter package according to your OS type.

```abap
cd /tmp
```

Now let's run the copied URL with the **wget** command

```abap
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.6.1/node_exporter-1.6.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Unzip the downloaded the file using below command

```abap
sudo tar xvfz node_exporter-*.*-amd64.tar.gz
```

Move the binary file of the node exporter to /usr/local/bin location

```abap
sudo mv node_exporter-*.*-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin/
```

Create a node\_exporter user to run the node-exporter service

```abap
sudo useradd -rs /bin/false node_exporter
```

**Step #7 Create Node Exporter Systemd service**

Create a node\_exporter service file in the /etc/systemd/system directory

```abap
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
```

```abap
[Unit]
```

```abap
Description=Node ExporterAfter=network.target[Service]User=node_exporterGroup=node_exporterType=simpleExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Now lets start and enable the node\_exporter service using the below commands

```abap
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start node_exporter
sudo systemctl enable node_exporter
sudo systemctl status node_exportersudo systemctl restart prometheussudo systemctl restart prometheussudo systemctl restart prometheussudo systemctl restart prometheussudo systemctl restart prometheussudo systemctl restart prometheussudo systemctl restart prometheussudo systemctl restart prometheussudo systemctl restart prometheussudo systemctl restart prometheussudo systemctl restart prometheus
```

**Step #8:Configure the Node Exporter as a Prometheus target**

Now to scrape the node\_exporter lets instruct the Prometheus by making a minor change in prometheus.yml file

So go to etc/prometheus and open prometheus.yml

```abap
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

```abap
- job_name: 'Node_Exporter'
```

```abap
    scrape_interval: 5s    static_configs:      - targets: ['<Server_IP_of_Node_Exporter_Machine>:9100']
```

Now restart the Prometheus Service

```abap
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```

Hit the URL in your web browser to check whether our target is successfully scraped by Prometheus or not

**Step #9:Install Grafana on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**

Now let's Install Grafana for wonderful dashboards and data visualization for monitoring systems, servers, services, etc

We can install grafana on Ubuntu either by downloading the .deb package from the Grafana Download page or using APT which is easier.

Add the Grafana GPG key in Ubuntu using wget

```abap
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

Next, add the Grafana repository to your APT sources:

```abap
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
```

Refresh your APT cache to update your package lists:

```abap
sudo apt update
```

You can now proceed with the installation:

```abap
sudo apt install grafana
```

Once Grafana is installed, use systemctl to start the Grafana server:

```abap
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
```

Next, verify that Grafana is running by checking the service’s status:

```abap
sudo systemctl status grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
```

To access the Grafana Dashboard open your favorite browser, type server IP or Name followed by grafana default port 3000.

```abap
http://your_ip:3000
```

Here you can see the Login page of Grafana now you will have to login with below Grafana default UserName and Password.

```abap
Username – admin
```

```abap
Password – admin
```

Now here you can see the Home Dashboard page of Grafana

**Step #10:Configure Prometheus as Grafana DataSource**

Configure Prometheus as Grafana DataSource

As per your requirement, you can make other changes or you can also keep the remaining configuration as default.

Now click on **Save & test** so it will prompt a message **Data Source is working**.

---

## **Step #11 Creating Grafana Dashboard to Monitor Linux Server**

Now let's build a dashboard in Grafana so that it will be able to reflect the metrics of the Linux system.

So we will use 14513 to import [Grafana.com](http://Grafana.com), Let's come to the Grafana Home page and you can see a **“+”** icon. Click on that and select **“Import”**

Now provide the [Grafana.com](http://Grafana.com) Dashboard ID which is **14513** and click on **Load**

Now provide the name select the Prometheus Datasource and click on **Import**.

There you are done with the setup. Now your Dashboard is running up!.

**If more time were available, further optimizations could include:**

**Docker Swarm/Kubernetes:** Consider using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling of containers to handle increased traffic and ensure high availability.

**Jenkins Pipeline:** Enhance the Jenkins pipeline by adding more stages for automated testing, security scanning, and deployment to multiple environments (staging, production).

**Monitoring Improvements:** Implement alerting based on critical application metrics to proactively address issues. Additionally, consider incorporating logging solutions like ELK Stack for comprehensive application monitoring.

# **Conclusion:**

Completed the assignment by deploying an open-source project with SQLite using Docker, NGINX, and Jenkins, and setting up monitoring

In this assignment, I successfully deployed open-source WordPress project using Docker, NGINX, and Jenkins. I also set up monitoring for real-time performance analysis.
