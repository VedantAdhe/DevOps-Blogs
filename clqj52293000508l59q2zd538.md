## **TASK 2:**

#### Understand the concept of CloudFront and try to perform below sub-tasks:

\- What is caching in cloudfront?

\- Create an EC2 instance with apache webserver

\- Create a CloudFront distribution and attach to EC2 instance to access the apache webpage.

### What is Caching in CloudFront?

**Caching in CloudFront:** Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that speeds up the distribution of your content to end-users. Caching in CloudFront involves storing copies of your content (e.g., web pages, images, videos) in multiple edge locations around the world. This allows users to access the content from a location closer to them, reducing latency and improving performance.

CloudFront supports different caching mechanisms, including:

1. **Edge Cache:** Content is cached at CloudFront edge locations globally.
    
2. **Origin Cache:** Content is cached at the origin (e.g., an S3 bucket or an EC2 instance).
    
3. **Browser Cache:** CloudFront can instruct browsers to cache content locally.
    

### Create an EC2 Instance with Apache Web Server

1. **Launch EC2 Instance:**
    
    * In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the EC2 service.
        
    * Launch a new EC2 instance, choosing an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with Apache pre-installed (e.g., Amazon Linux).
        
2. **Configure Security Group:**
    
    * Ensure that your EC2 instance's security group allows incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP).
        
3. **Access Apache Web Server:**
    
    * Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH.
        
    * Test the Apache web server by accessing the public IP or DNS of your instance in a web browser.
        

### Create a CloudFront Distribution and Attach to EC2 Instance

1. **Navigate to CloudFront:**
    
    * In the AWS Management Console, go to the CloudFront service.
        
2. **Create CloudFront Distribution:**
    
    * Click on "Create Distribution."
        
    * Choose the delivery method (Web or RTMP).
        
    * Set the origin settings to point to your EC2 instance's public DNS or IP.
        
3. **Configure Additional Settings:**
    
    * Configure additional settings, including caching behavior, viewer protocol policy, and any other desired options.
        
4. **Create the Distribution:**
    
    * Click on "Create Distribution" to create your CloudFront distribution.
        
5. **Wait for Deployment:**
    
    * It may take some time for the CloudFront distribution to deploy. Monitor the status in the CloudFront console.
        
6. **Access Content via CloudFront:**
    
    * Once deployed, use the provided CloudFront domain name to access your content.
        

### Test and Verify:

* Access the Apache web page using both the direct EC2 instance URL and the CloudFront domain name. Note the differences in response times.
    

### Clean Up (Optional):

* If you want to avoid additional charges, consider deleting the CloudFront distribution and terminating the EC2 instance.
    

These steps should help you understand caching in CloudFront and how to integrate it with an EC2 instance running an Apache web server.
