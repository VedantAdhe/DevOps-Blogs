### What is AWS WAF?

**AWS WAF** is (Web Application Firewall) is a service that protects web applications from malicious attacks by filtering and monitoring incoming traffic based on defined rules. It safeguards against common web vulnerabilities such as **SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and more.**

AWS WAF lets you control access to your content. Based on criteria that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, **the service associated with your protected resource responds to requests either with the requested content, with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response.**

**AWS WAF components:**

1. **Web ACLs** – We use a web access control list (ACL) to protect a set of AWS resources. We create a web ACL and define its protection strategy by adding rules.
    
2. **Rules** – Each rule contains a statement that defines the inspection criteria, and an action to take if a web request meets the criteria. When a web request meets the criteria, that's a match. You can configure rules to block matching requests, allow them through, count them, or run bot controls against them that use CAPTCHA puzzles or silent client browser challenges.
    
3. **Rule groups** – You can define rules directly inside a web ACL or in reusable rule groups. AWS Managed Rules and AWS Marketplace sellers provide managed rule groups for your use. You can also define your own rule groups.

### Here's a real-time scenario to illustrate the use of AWS WAF

---

### **Scenario: Securing an E-commerce Website**

#### Background:

Imagine you are responsible for the security of an e-commerce website hosted on AWS. Your website is built using Amazon EC2 instances and is fronted by an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). To enhance security, you decide to implement AWS WAF to protect against common web attacks.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Set Up AWS WAF:**
    
    * Go to the AWS WAF console and create a new web ACL (Access Control List).
        
    * Define rules within the web ACL to filter and block traffic based on specific conditions (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
        
2. **Integrate with Amazon CloudFront:**
    
    * Configure CloudFront, AWS's content delivery network, as the distribution for your website.
        
    * Associate the AWS WAF web ACL with the CloudFront distribution to inspect and filter traffic before it reaches your EC2 instances.
        
3. **Create Rules for Common Attacks:**
    
    * Create rules to identify and block SQL injection attempts.
        
    * Implement rules to detect and prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
        
4. **Monitor and Fine-Tune:**
    
    * Enable logging in AWS WAF to monitor traffic and identify potential threats.
        
    * Regularly review logs and adjust rules as needed to adapt to emerging threats or changing application behavior.
        

#### Real-time Scenario:

Let's say an attacker attempts a SQL injection attack on your e-commerce website by entering malicious code into a search box. Without AWS WAF, this attack could potentially compromise your database.

However, with AWS WAF in place:

1. **Detection:**
    
    * The malicious SQL injection attempt triggers the SQL injection rule defined in your AWS WAF web ACL.
        
2. **Blocking:**
    
    * AWS WAF identifies the attack and blocks the malicious request before it reaches your EC2 instances.
        
3. **Logging and Analysis:**
    
    * Details of the blocked request are logged, providing insights into the nature of the attack and the source of the malicious traffic.
        
4. **Automated Protection:**
    
    * AWS WAF continues to protect your website automatically, adapting to new threats based on the rules you've configured.
        

By implementing AWS WAF, you've added layer of security to your e-commerce website, protecting it from common web exploits and ensuring the integrity and availability of your online services.
