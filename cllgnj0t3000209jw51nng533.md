### Introduction:

* A two-tier Flask application with a MySQL database using Docker Compose is a modern and efficient way to build and deploy web applications.
    
* In this architecture, the application is split into two different tiers: the front-end (Flask application) and the back-end (MySQL database).
    
* Docker Compose, a tool for defining and running Docker applications with multiple containers, simplifies the setup and management of these components in a consistent and isolated environment.
    
* . We assume you have a basic understanding of Git, Docker, and Python. Let's get started
    

---

### Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have met the following requirements:

* Basic understanding of Git, Docker, and Python.
    
* Open port 5000 in your server inbound rule (security group)
    
* Docker is installed and running on your system. You should also be added to the
    
* Docker group to run Docker commands without sudo.
    
* Internet connection to clone the GitHub repository and download Docker [images.es](http://images.es)
    

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

### Let's start by cloning the repository containing the source code for our two-tier application. Open your terminal and execute the following commands:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692362519229/98961a3b-d9fa-41d1-bbff-0fd23ce5556e.png align="center")

```bash
https://github.com/VedantAdhe/Dockerprojects.git

cd Dockerproject
```

* You're now ready for the project
    

---

### Step 2: Let's Create a Dockerfile

* write a docker file for Python application (app.py)

* Build the docker file using Docker Build Command
    
* After the build is completed use the docker Image command to check for the image is created.

* See the two-tier image is build
    

---

### Step 3: Install Docker Compose

* If you haven't already installed Docker Compose, no worries! Run this command to install it:
    
* Docker Compose will help us manage our multi-container application effortlessly.
    

```bash
Sudo apt install docker-compose
```

---

### Step 4: Start the Application with Docker Compose

Now, let's use Docker Compose to start our two-tier application. Execute this command in the terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will create and start the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file in detached mode. Smooth sailing ahead

---

### **Step 5: Verify Containers**

To make sure everything is up and running, execute the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```

---

### Step 6: Create a MYSQL Data Volume

Now, let's create a data volume to store the MySQL data. Run this command

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql/
```

---

### **Step 7: Access MySQL Database**

It is time to deal with the MySQL database running in the container. First, determine the container name using the docker ps command. Then use the following command to access the MySQL shell:

```bash
docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME bash 

mysql -u root -p
```

---

### **Step 8: Create table messages along with column**

You must enter the MySQL root password. Once logged in, run these SQL commands to interact with the database:

```bash
use two_tier;

show tables;

create table messages (message varchar(255));

describe messages;
```

---

### **Step 9: Access the Application**

To witness your Flask application in action, open a web browser and enter the following URL:

```bash
URL : * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Running on http://172.17.0.2:5000
```

## **Conclusion:**

Congratulations, we have successfully built a two-tier Flask application using docker-compose. This architecture provides a lightweight and efficient way to develop, deploy, and manage web applications. By containerizing both the Flask application and MySQL database, developers can create consistent and isolated environments that simplify deployment and reduce compatibility issues.

Docker Compose further enhances this process by allowing you to define and manage multi-container applications from a single configuration file.

This architecture separates application logic (Flask) from data storage and retrieval (MySQL), promoting modularity and scalability. Developers benefit from a clear project structure, a consistent environment, and the ability to easily share their applications with others. Docker Compose's orchestration features make it easy to start, stop, and scale the application, enabling smoother development flows and more efficient collaboration between team members.

In summary, the combination of Flask, MySQL and Docker Compose enables developers to build robust and scalable web applications, simplify the deployment process and promote a more manageable development cycle.
