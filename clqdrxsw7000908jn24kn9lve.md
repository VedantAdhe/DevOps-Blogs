### What is S3 Bucket in AWS?

At Amazon Web Services (AWS), an S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket is a container for storing and organizing data in the form of objects. S3 is a scalable object storage service that allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data from any location on the Internet. Each object in an S3 bucket is stored as a file, and each file can be between a few bytes and terabytes in size.

Key features of S3 buckets include:

1. Scalability: S3 is designed to scale automatically so that users can store an unlimited amount of data.
    
2. Durability and availability: S3 offers high durability and availability as the data is stored in multiple physical locations. This ensures that your data remains accessible even if a data center fails.
    
3. Security: S3 offers a range of security features, including access control lists (ACLs), bucket policies and server-side encryption to protect your data.
    
4. Versioning: S3 supports versioning, so you can keep, retrieve and restore any version of any object stored in a bucket.
    
5. Lifecycle management: Users can define lifecycle policies to automatically move objects between storage classes or delete them when they are no longer needed.
    
6. Access control: With S3, you can control access to your buckets and objects using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs).
    

To use an S3 bucket, you create a bucket in a specific AWS region and then upload your objects (files) into that bucket. Each bucket has a globally unique name within AWS, and the objects in a bucket are accessible via a unique URL.

S3 is widely used for various purposes, including data backup and archiving, static website hosting, data distribution, and as a storage backend for applications running on AWS.

## What is IAM in AWS?

IAM stands for Identity and Access Management and is an important service of Amazon Web Services (AWS). With IAM, you can securely control access to AWS services and resources. It allows you to manage users, groups and authorizations within your AWS environment.

The most important functions of IAM in AWS include

1. Users: IAM allows you to create and manage individual users within your AWS account. Each user can have unique security credentials (e.g. access keys) and specific permissions.
    
2. Groups: Users can be organized into groups, and permissions can be assigned to groups rather than individual users. This simplifies the management of permissions for multiple users who require similar levels of access.
    
3. Roles: IAM roles define a set of permissions for requesting AWS services. Roles are not associated with a specific user or group. Instead, they are inherited by entities such as users, AWS services or even external identities.
    
4. **Policies:** Permissions in IAM are defined through policies. Policies are JSON documents that specify the actions allowed or denied for users, groups, or roles, as well as the resources to which the permissions apply.
    
5. **Access Keys:** IAM allows users to generate access keys (access key ID and secret access key) for programmatic access to AWS services through the API or command line interface (CLI).
    
6. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** IAM supports MFA, adding an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a unique authentication code from their MFA device in addition to their regular credentials.
    
7. **Identity Federation:** IAM supports identity federation, allowing you to integrate your existing identity systems with AWS. This enables users to sign in to the AWS Management Console or make programmatic requests to AWS services using their existing corporate credentials.
    

IAM plays a crucial role in maintaining a secure and well-managed AWS environment by enforcing the principle of least privilege, where users are granted only the permissions they need to perform their tasks. This helps enhance security and compliance while providing flexibility in managing access to AWS resources.

## What is AWSCLI?

AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) is a unified tool provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to interact with various AWS services directly from the command line. It provides a command-line interface for performing tasks such as managing AWS resources, configuring services, and automating workflows.

Key features of AWS CLI include:

1. **Cross-Service Operations:** AWS CLI enables users to interact with multiple AWS services, including Amazon S3, EC2, Lambda, IAM, and more, using a consistent set of commands.
    
2. **Scripting and Automation:** AWS CLI is designed to be script-friendly, allowing users to automate AWS tasks by incorporating AWS CLI commands into scripts and workflows.
    
3. **Configuration Management:** Users can configure AWS CLI with their AWS access key, secret key, default region, and other settings. This makes it easier to use AWS CLI commands without repeatedly specifying these parameters.
    
4. **Output Formats:** AWS CLI supports various output formats, including JSON, text, and table, allowing users to choose the format that best suits their needs.
    
5. **Interactive Mode:** AWS CLI provides an interactive mode that allows users to enter commands interactively, making it easier to explore and execute AWS operations.
    
6. **Integration with Other Tools:** AWS CLI can be integrated with other command-line tools and scripts, making it a versatile tool for building and managing AWS infrastructure.
    

To use AWS CLI, users typically install the AWS CLI software on their local machines, configure it with their AWS credentials, and then use the provided commands to interact with AWS services. For example, you can use AWS CLI to create and manage EC2 instances, upload files to S3 buckets, configure IAM policies, and more.

AWS CLI is a powerful and flexible tool that complements other AWS management interfaces, such as the AWS Management Console and SDKs (Software Development Kits), providing users with multiple options for interacting with AWS services based on their preferences and requirements.

### Task 1

1. ### Make a private S3 bucket in AWS and change the policy so you can access its stuff without making it public.
    

Creating a private S3 bucket in AWS and configuring its access policies to ensure that only authorized users can access its contents is a common practice for securing data. Below are the steps to achieve this using the AWS Management Console:

1. **Sign in to AWS Console:**
    
    * Navigate to the AWS Management Console: [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/).
        
    * Sign in with your AWS account credentials.
        
2. **Open S3 Service:**
    
    * In the AWS Management Console, find and click on "S3" under the "Storage" category.
        
3. **Create a new S3 Bucket:**
    
    * Click on the "Create bucket" button.
        
    * Enter a unique and meaningful name for your bucket.
        
    * Choose a region for your bucket.
        
    * Click "Next" until you reach the "Set permissions" step.
        
4. **Set Permissions:**
    
    * In the "Set permissions" step, uncheck the "Block all public access" checkbox. This ensures that your bucket doesn't have public access by default.
        
5. **Configure Bucket Policy:**
    
    * Once the bucket is created, select it from the S3 dashboard.
        
    * Navigate to the "Permissions" tab.
        
    * Click on "Bucket Policy."
        
6. **Add Bucket Policy:**
    
    * Replace the existing bucket policy with a policy that grants specific access to authorized users or roles. Below is an example policy that grants full access to the bucket to a specific IAM user (replace `<YOUR-USER-ARN>` with your actual IAM user's ARN):
        
        ```yaml
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": {
                "AWS": "<YOUR-USER-ARN>"
              },
              "Action": "s3:*",
              "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
        
        This example grants full access to the specified IAM user. You may need to customize the policy based on your specific use case.
        
    * Click "Save changes" to apply the new policy.
        
7. **Test Access:**
    
    * To test whether your setup is working, try accessing the S3 bucket using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or any other method with the IAM user specified in the policy.

1. ### Task 2: Configure AWSCLI on your Ubuntu machine.
    

To configure the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) on your Ubuntu machine, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Install AWS CLI:** Open a terminal on your Ubuntu machine and run the following command to install the AWS CLI:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install awscli
    ```
    
2. **Configure AWS CLI:** After installing the AWS CLI, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials. If you don't have AWS access key ID and secret access key, you can generate them in the AWS Management Console under the IAM (Identity and Access Management) section.
    
    Run the following command and follow the prompts to enter your AWS access key, secret key, default region, and output format:
    
    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    Default region name [None]: your-preferred-region
    Default output format [None]: json
    ```
    
    Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY`, `YOUR_SECRET_KEY`, and `your-preferred-region` with your actual AWS credentials and preferred region.
    
3. **Verify Configuration:** To verify that the AWS CLI is configured correctly, you can run a simple command, such as listing your S3 buckets:
    
    ```bash
    aws s3 ls
    ```
    
    If configured correctly, you should see a list of your S3 buckets.
    

Now, your AWS CLI is configured on your Ubuntu machine, and you can use it to interact with various AWS services from the command line. Ensure that you keep your AWS credentials secure and do not share them openly. If you are using the AWS CLI for scripting or automation, consider using IAM roles and policies to manage permissions securely.

### Task 3: Create an EC2 instance using AWSCLI

  
To create an EC2 instance using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Terminal:** Open a terminal on your local machine.
    
2. **Run the AWS CLI Command to Launch an EC2 Instance:** Use the `aws ec2 run-instances` command to launch an EC2 instance. You will need to specify parameters such as the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), instance type, key pair, and optionally the security group.
    
    Here is an example command:
    
    ```bash
    aws ec2 run-instances \
      --image-id ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
      --instance-type t2.micro \
      --key-name YourKeyPairName \
      --security-group-ids YourSecurityGroupId \
      --subnet-id YourSubnetId \
      --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=YourInstanceName}]'
    ```
    
    Replace the placeholder values with your actual information:
    
    * `ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`: The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) you want to use.
        
    * `t2.micro`: The instance type. You can choose a different type based on your requirements.
        
    * `YourKeyPairName`: The name of your EC2 key pair.
        
    * `YourSecurityGroupId`: The ID of the security group for your instance.
        
    * `YourSubnetId`: The ID of the subnet in which to launch the instance.
        
    * `YourInstanceName`: A name tag for your instance.
        
    
    Note: Ensure that your AWS CLI is configured with the necessary credentials (using `aws configure`).
    
3. **Access and Manage Your Instance:** Once the instance is launched, you can manage it using various AWS CLI commands. For example:
    
    * To describe your instances:
        
        ```bash
        aws ec2 describe-instances
        ```
        
    * To terminate an instance:
        
        ```basic
        aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids YourInstanceId
        ```
        
    
    Replace `YourInstanceId` with the actual ID of your EC2 instance.
    

Remember to manage your EC2 instances responsibly, and be aware of the associated costs. Adjust the instance type, security group, and other parameters based on your specific requirements.
